# Single Species Reaction Diffusion Simulator

The simulation program uses C# and C (Lambiri, 2021a) and was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (Microsoft, 2019) and CUDAv11 (NVIDIA, 2021). The program requires an NVIDIA graphics card to run. Our setup is using a laptop version of the NVIDIA RTX2060 with 6GB of graphics memory. The program uses an open-source package called Cudafy.Net (Pomianowski, 2019/2019) to connect the C# environment and CUDA.
